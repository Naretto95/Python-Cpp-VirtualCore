# Python.Cpp-VirtualCore

This repository contains a virtual core project implemented in C++, along with a compiler written in Python. The virtual core can be used to simulate different types of processors and execute instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to have a C++ compiler and Python 3 installed on your computer. Once you have the required dependencies, you can download the source code from this repository and compile the C++ files using your preferred C++ compiler. The compiler can be run using the command `python3 compiler.py [source_file]`. To use the core, use the command `./core [BINARYFILE] [STATEFILE] [-v]`

## Usage

The virtual core can be used to simulate different types of processors and execute instructions. The compiler translates the input source code written in a virtual assembly language into the binary instruction set of the virtual core. The output file can be loaded into the virtual core and executed.
